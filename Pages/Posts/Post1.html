            I started learning how to code on July 6th, 2024 (aka last Saturday). The best part is:
            I don't know why I did it. Seriously, I really don't know why I simply started learning
            how to code. I've always been the "tech guy" throughout my whole life (I'm 20), but I never
            had the initiative to start coding. Well, until three days ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            I downloaded <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a> to write my notes and opened <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a> to learn HTML. To my surprise,
            it's very easy. It's basically just English. Now I know why so many people don't consider it
            a proper programming language (LOL).
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, I think I've learned enough to build a <em>VERY</em> simple website like the one you're on right now.
            Currently, I only know how to use HTML, but tomorrow I'll start learning CSS to make
            this thing more beautiful.
