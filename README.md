Hey, my name is Davi and this is the repository for my first Website.
The website it's here because I'm hosting it on Github Pages.

I'm learning how to code, and right now I only know HTML.
I would love to receive some feedback, or simply talk with people that are in this "code world" longer than me.
So, if you want, you can send me a DM on twitter: https://x.com/davijung923/

See you
